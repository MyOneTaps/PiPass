# PiPass
PiPass is an extention to the Pi-Hole project which adds easy temporary unblocking functionality and a visually appealing blockpage. The whole project, currently, is written in php, so it will integrate very easily with your existing Pi-Hole system. The blockpage is very easy to use, presenting three distinct options, an automated, temporary unblock button among them.
